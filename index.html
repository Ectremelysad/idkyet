        <h1>Fuck the american school system</h1>
        <p>Did you know that politics affect what you learn? It's hilarious. It's also hilarious that low income neighborhoods have some of the shittiest schools because they are underfunded- fuck minorities I guess. What do minorities and poverty have to do with one another? DEFACTO SEGRATION. Crazy how the past still affects the present and the right wants to hide and drown it out. The fact that the system seems to be against us makes me seem to ask if this is all intentional. For a country with this many resources it would surprise me that those on top are oblivious to the social problems we have. Yet, politics dictate reactions. Here I will attempt to teach you everything at face value. Everyone in the past and almost everyone now was and is racist. Nothing new. We are prejudice as part of our human nature, but overcoming this nature helps separate humans from animals.
